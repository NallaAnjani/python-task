# interger: it is a one of the datatype 
# which are whole numbers it can be considered as interger
# ex:
a=10
b=20
print(a)
print(b)

# addition of two numbers
print(a+b)
# subtraction of two numbers
print(a-b)
# multiplication of two numbers
print(a*b)
# division of two numbers
print(a/b)
# exponential of two numbers(a power b)
print(a**b)
# floor division of two numbers it returns the integer  part from the output
print(a//b)
# subtraction of two numbers
# modulus of two numbers (its returns reminder )
print(a%b)



# float: the numbers which have decimal values
# ex:
num1=0.5
num1=7.8

# type: it defines the type of a datatype 
# ex:
type(a)
type(num1)

# string: it is collection of character enclosed in a single quotes or double  quotes
# spaces also taken by the string as a charcter
# ex:
str1="hello"
str2="  "

# length:it counts how many characters are present in the string
# ex:
aa="raju"
bb="mahesh babu"

# index:accessing the  one character from the string by using the indexing
# index value  starts form 0
# ex:
print(aa[1])
print(bb[7])

# slicing:if you want to accent the more than one character then use slicing
# ex:
str3="hello hyderbad"
